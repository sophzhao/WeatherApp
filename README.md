# WeatherApp

Mini Client project for 67328 Mobile to Cloud: Distrubuted Applications 

This web app successfully displays basic weather data for United States cities. Using Ajax requests to the server, we update the system with cities and states automatically populated. Wunderground Weather API was used with JSONP to update the screen with new weather data and create visually appealing displays. 10 instances of jQuery and helpful user interaction points are included to signify a more advanced app.
